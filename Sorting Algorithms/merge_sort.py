What is merge sort?
Mergesort is an efficient, general purpose and comparision based algorithm.
It is a devide and conquer algorithm.


Data structure          : Array/List
Worst-case performance  : O(n log n)
Best-case performance   : O(n log n) typical, O(n) natural variant
Average performance     : O(n log n)
Worst-case space complexity : Ðž(n) total with O(n) auxiliary, O(1) auxiliary with linked lists

Example:
    data = [20,4,5,3,25,6,667,443,888]
    sorted_data = [3, 4, 5, 6, 20, 25, 443, 443, 888]
